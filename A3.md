## 1)
Problem 3.11 Plot the solution as a function of "del", the error tolerance.

Apply the secant method developed in Section 3.3 to solve $f(x)=e^{x^2}\ln(x^2)-x=0$. Discuss the procedure for dealing with more than one
root in a given region.
 
## 2)
Problem 3.12 Plot the solution as a function of "del", the error tolerance.  Note, you can focus on just the 2-dimensional case.  No need for the code to work in higher dimensions. 

Develop a subprogram that implements the Newton method to solve **f**(**x**) =
**0**, where both **f** and **x** are $l$-dimensional vectors. Test the subprogram with
$$f_1(x_1,x_2)=e^{x_1^2}\ln(x_2)-x_1^2$$ and $$f_2(x_1,x_2)=e^{x_2}\ln(x_1)-x_2^2$$.
 
## 3)
Simpson Rule with non-Uniform Data points:
 
### Part a)
Construct a program to approximate the integral of a Gaussian on the whole line:
$$ S = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{x^2}dx $$
using the Simpson rule with a non-uniform mesh for x.  For the mesh, choose: $x_j = he^{\alpha j^2}$ where $\alpha$ and $h$ are small constants. To estimate error, plot the exact answer and your results for different numbers of discrete points in the mesh.  

### Part b)
Use the adaptive Simpson code (See text, Chapter 3) to compute $S$. Plot the tolerance (the error) against the number of divisions needed along the x-axis.  Compare with your results from part a.  Which method requires the fewest number of partitions along the x axis to meet the same tolerance?
